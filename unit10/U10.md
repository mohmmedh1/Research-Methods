\# Unit 10 – Research Writing and Proposal Presentation



\## 1. Overview

This unit consolidated the core components of academic \*\*research writing\*\* — transforming analytical findings, methodological planning, and statistical interpretation into a coherent, publishable format.  

As Saunders, Lewis, and Thornhill (2023) emphasise, effective research writing bridges the gap between knowledge creation and communication. It requires clarity, structure, and critical synthesis to present ideas that are both academically rigorous and professionally relevant.



By this stage, I integrated all prior learning — ethics, methodology, data collection, and statistical analysis — into a structured \*\*Research Proposal Presentation\*\* and accompanying \*\*Statistical Worksheet\*\* submission. Together, these artefacts demonstrate readiness for dissertation-level research and professional dissemination.

\## 2. Research Proposal Presentation

The \*\*Research Proposal Presentation\*\* marked a key milestone, combining theoretical and practical insights into a single cohesive proposal.  

My presentation focused on the topic:



> \*\*“Evaluating Cloud Security Risks in Higher Education Institutions: A Mixed-Methods Approach.”\*\*



The proposal included:

\- \*\*Introduction \& Rationale:\*\* Justification for investigating cloud security within higher education, referencing ENISA (2023) and EDUCAUSE (2024).

\- \*\*Research Aim \& Objectives:\*\* To identify, classify, and mitigate cloud-related risks across governance, compliance, and operational domains.

\- \*\*Methodology:\*\* Mixed-methods design integrating qualitative interviews with IT administrators and quantitative incident data analysis.

\- \*\*Ethical Considerations:\*\* Adherence to BCS and ACM Codes, GDPR, and UAE Data Protection Law.

\- \*\*Expected Outcomes:\*\* Development of a practical framework aligning academic cloud governance with ISO 27001 principles.



Feedback acknowledged the strong structure, logical flow, and professional delivery, recommending refinement in the literature integration and inclusion of clearer data triangulation methods.

\## 3. e-Portfolio Activity – Statistical Worksheet Submission

The \*\*Statistical Worksheet\*\* exercise enhanced my quantitative analysis proficiency, linking inferential statistics to practical cybersecurity contexts.  

Using Excel and SPSS, I practised:

\- \*\*Descriptive Statistics:\*\* Summarising data distributions from simulated cloud incident datasets.  

\- \*\*Inferential Analysis:\*\* Applying \*t-tests\* and \*correlation coefficients\* to validate relationships between risk variables and governance maturity.  

\- \*\*Data Visualisation:\*\* Producing interpretable charts and pivot tables for inclusion in research documentation.



This activity reinforced the importance of \*\*data integrity\*\*, \*\*validity\*\*, and \*\*reproducibility\*\*—core standards in cybersecurity research. These skills directly support future dissertation-level data analysis and align with ISO 31000’s risk-modelling practices.

\## 4. Reflection

Unit 10 represented a synthesis of research capability, integrating communication, analysis, and methodology into a professional academic product.  

Developing and delivering the proposal presentation honed my ability to translate technical cybersecurity insights into accessible, research-driven narratives.  



I recognised that writing is not simply documentation but an analytical process that clarifies thought, strengthens argumentation, and demonstrates scholarly maturity.  

By submitting both the proposal and statistical worksheets, I demonstrated readiness for the transition from \*\*proposal design\*\* to \*\*independent research execution\*\*.
