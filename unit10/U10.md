# Unit 10 â€“ Research Writing and Proposal Presentation

## 1. Overview
This unit consolidated the essential skills of **research writing and reporting**, transforming analytical findings, methodological frameworks, and statistical outcomes into a structured academic proposal.  
As Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill (2023) emphasise, research writing connects *knowledge creation* with *knowledge communication*, ensuring that technical work is accessible, logical, and critically reasoned.

Building upon the earlier stages of this moduleâ€”ethics, methodology, and data analysisâ€”I prepared and submitted two key artefacts:  
1. The **Research Proposal Presentation**, titled *A CyBOK-Based Framework for Managing Cloud Security Risks in Higher Education Institutions*.  
2. The **Statistical Worksheet Submission**, which presented the quantitative analyses developed in Units 7â€“9.

Together, these submissions demonstrate readiness for dissertation-level research and professional publication.

## 2. Research Proposal Presentation

The presentation served as the culmination of my methodological and analytical journey. It articulated a structured approach to mitigating **cloud-security risks within higher education**, combining CyBOK-aligned theoretical grounding with practical research design.  

**Key proposal components included:**
- **Research Problem:** Universitiesâ€™ growing reliance on cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) and the related surge in ransomware and compliance risks.  
- **Aim and Objectives:** To identify, classify, and mitigate cloud-security risks while aligning with CyBOK, NIST SP 800-53, and ISO 27017 frameworks.  
- **Methodology:** A **mixed-methods** design integrating surveys (quantitative) and interviews (qualitative) to achieve triangulated insights.  
- **Ethical Governance:** GDPR, UAE Data Law, and BCS/ACM Codes were embedded throughout to ensure participant protection and lawful data handling.  
- **Expected Outcomes:** Development of a practical, resource-efficient risk-management framework tailored to universitiesâ€™ constraints.  

The proposal emphasised *pragmatism*â€”balancing theoretical rigour with real-world feasibilityâ€”and outlined a 16-week research timeline covering design, data collection, and analysis phases.  
Tutor feedback highlighted strong structure, clarity, and professionalism, recommending only minor enhancements in data-triangulation detail and visual-design coherence.

## 3. e-Portfolio Activity â€“ Statistical Worksheet Submission

To complement the proposal, I submitted **Statistical Worksheets** for formative review, consolidating analytical work from Units 7â€“9.  
This exercise demonstrated competency in applying quantitative methods to cybersecurity research, specifically in the context of **cloud-risk analysis**.

**Key techniques applied:**
- **Descriptive statistics:** summarising incident-data distributions and governance-maturity scores.  
- **Inferential statistics:** using *t-tests* and *correlation* to identify relationships between institutional preparedness and breach frequency.  
- **Data visualisation:** using Excel/SPSS to create ethical, reproducible graphs for inclusion in the dissertation report.  

The worksheets reinforced my understanding of **data validity**, **reliability**, and **reproducibility**, and ensured adherence to ISO 31000 risk-management and ISO 27001 data-governance standards.

**Submitted Files:**
- `Unit7_Inferential_Statistics_and_Hypothesis_Testing.pdf`  
- `Unit8_Data_Analysis_and_Visualisation.pdf`  
- `Unit9_Validity_and_Generalisability.pdf`

These analyses received positive formative feedback for clarity, correct statistical interpretation, and effective integration with my mixed-methods design.

## 4. Reflection
Unit 10 represented the synthesis of technical expertise, methodological coherence, and academic communication.  
Developing the proposal presentation strengthened my ability to articulate cybersecurity challenges in structured academic language, while the statistical analysis validated my ability to translate quantitative findings into actionable insight.

This stage also reaffirmed the importance of **ethical precision**, **transparent reporting**, and **scholarly communication**â€”critical elements for both my dissertation and my professional research practice at MBZUH.

By completing this unit, I achieved a cohesive bridge between **proposal design** and **independent empirical research**, demonstrating readiness for the MSc dissertation stage.
