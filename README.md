# üìö **Research Methods and Professional Practice ‚Äì e-Portfolio Index**

This repository documents my full academic progression through the **Research Methods & Professional Practice (RMPP_PCOM7E)** module as part of the **MSc Cyber Security** programme at the **University of Essex Online**.

Each unit folder contains original artefacts, seminar reflections, tutor feedback, and evidence demonstrating how theory translates into research competence and professional growth.
