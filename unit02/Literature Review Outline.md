## 1. Aim of the Review

To critically evaluate key security risks associated with cloud computing in the higher education sector by synthesizing academic and industry literature. The review will identify major threats, examine diverse mitigation perspectives, and propose appropriate sector strategies for improvement.

---

## 2. Rationale and Context

The adoption of cloud computing in higher education is accelerating, driven by demands for remote access, digital learning, and scalable infrastructure. However, this expansion introduces new layers of cyber risk, particularly in environments that value openness and decentralization. This review aims to address the gap in sector-specific understanding of cloud vulnerabilities and institutional governance challenges.

---

## 6. Research Questions 

1. What are the predominant cloud security risks facing higher education institutions?
2. How do governance and compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, NESA) influence cloud risk management in HEIs?
3. What mitigation approaches have proven most effective in addressing these threats within educational environments?
4. What gaps exist in the current research that hinder the development of a sector-wide security framework?
