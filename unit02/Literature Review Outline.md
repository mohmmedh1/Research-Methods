# Unit 2 – Research Questions, the Literature Review, and the Research Proposal

## 1. Overview
This unit focused on developing the foundation of academic research design — transitioning from identifying a broad area of interest to formulating **precise research questions** and constructing a **literature review**.  
Building upon Unit 1’s emphasis on ethics and reasoning, this stage introduced the structure and purpose of a research proposal, the role of the literature review within it, and the process of transforming initial ideas into viable research questions (Boza, 2022).

A literature review is not simply a summary of sources but a **critical synthesis** of existing research. It identifies key theories, methodologies, and gaps in knowledge. In this unit, I applied these principles to refine my research focus on *cloud security risks in the higher education sector* — a theme that directly aligns with my professional role and academic interests.

## 2. Research Questions and Proposal Development
The process began with defining a clear **research aim** and **supporting questions**, guided by the SMART and FINER (Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical, Relevant) criteria.  
Following the guidance in Boza (2022), I refined broad ideas on cybersecurity into a manageable and sector-specific focus. My work resulted in the research questions outlined in my literature review plan, addressing governance, compliance, and mitigation in educational cloud environments.

Through the **e-Portfolio activity**, I also drafted the core structure of my proposal, including the aim, rationale, literature strategy, and risk categories to explore. This structured thinking ensured my research design is **logical, evidence-based, and aligned with professional standards**.

## 3. Literature Review Outline Summary

**Key Highlights:**
- **Aim:** To critically evaluate key security risks associated with cloud computing in the higher education sector.  
- **Rationale:** Cloud adoption in academia introduces new vulnerabilities in open digital ecosystems.  
- **Databases Used:** IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Google Scholar, and Essex Library.  
- **Themes Identified:** Misconfiguration, insider threats, insecure APIs, compliance, and shared responsibility confusion.  
- **Frameworks Referenced:** NIST (2018), CSA (2022), ENISA (2023), and EDUCAUSE (2024).  
- **Research Questions:**  
  1. What are the predominant cloud security risks facing HEIs?  
  2. How do governance and compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, NESA) influence cloud risk management?  
  3. What mitigation strategies are most effective in educational settings?  
  4. What research gaps remain in establishing a sector-wide security model? :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 4. Reflection
This unit strengthened my ability to think **strategically and analytically** about research.  
I learned how to transform professional experience into academically sound research questions and how to justify my topic through literature mapping.  
The exercise deepened my understanding of critical evaluation, as I began distinguishing between descriptive summaries and analytical synthesis — an essential skill for my forthcoming literature review.

Furthermore, linking the proposal structure to real-world cloud governance frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF, GDPR, NESA) gave me a strong foundation to connect theory and practice in later units.  
Overall, Unit 2 enhanced my confidence in defining a research scope that is both academically rigorous and professionally relevant.
