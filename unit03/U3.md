\# Unit 3 – Methodology and Research Methods



\## 1. Overview

This unit deepened my understanding of \*\*research methodology\*\* and the philosophical assumptions that underpin all academic inquiry.  

As Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill (2023) note, methodology is not merely the selection of tools but the theoretical lens through which research is conceived and interpreted.  

Researchers must therefore recognise the impact of their \*\*ontological\*\* (reality), \*\*epistemological\*\* (knowledge), and \*\*axiological\*\* (values) assumptions on every stage of the research process.  



For my investigation into \*cloud security risks within higher education\*, this realisation was transformative. It highlighted that methodological choices must align with both the research purpose and the nature of the phenomena being studied—combining rigour, transparency, and contextual awareness.

\## 2. Research Design

A coherent \*\*research design\*\* acts as the blueprint for how data will be collected, analysed, and interpreted.  

Following British Research Methodology (n.d.), I distinguished between the two dominant design paradigms:



\- \*\*Exploratory research\*\* – suitable for examining emerging or underexplored issues and generating new insights.  

\- \*\*Conclusive (descriptive) research\*\* – used to test hypotheses and quantify relationships between variables.  



Given the evolving and context-specific nature of cloud adoption in universities, my study adopts an \*\*exploratory–descriptive design\*\*.  

This dual structure enables both discovery (identifying emerging risks and governance gaps) and validation (categorising patterns of vulnerabilities and compliance practices).  

Such a design balances the open inquiry typical of exploratory studies with the analytical discipline required in descriptive research.

\## 3. Research Methods and Data Sources

The unit differentiated between \*\*qualitative\*\*, \*\*quantitative\*\*, and \*\*mixed-methods\*\* research approaches (Sage, 2021):  



\- \*\*Qualitative methods\*\* explore perceptions, behaviours, and processes. They are inductive and ideal for understanding \*why\* and \*how\* phenomena occur.  

\- \*\*Quantitative methods\*\* measure variables numerically, enabling statistical inference and generalisation.  

\- \*\*Mixed-methods research\*\* integrates both paradigms to achieve methodological triangulation and richer analysis.



For my research, a \*\*mixed-methods approach\*\* is most appropriate. It combines:  

\- \*Qualitative evidence\* from expert interviews, institutional policies, and case studies to interpret governance and cultural factors.  

\- \*Quantitative evidence\* from incident reports, compliance audits, and published datasets to measure the scale and frequency of security breaches.  



This methodological synergy supports a pragmatic stance, allowing theoretical depth while ensuring results remain empirically grounded and applicable to real-world institutional practice.

\## 4. e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review

The \*\*Research Proposal Review\*\* activity provided a structured opportunity to evaluate the internal coherence of my draft proposal.  

I critically examined the alignment between my \*\*research aim\*\*, \*\*questions\*\*, and \*\*methodological framework\*\*, ensuring consistency between the philosophical foundations and practical procedures.



Through peer feedback and reflection, I refined my rationale for using a mixed-methods design and clarified how each research question would be addressed through specific data-collection techniques.  

For instance, \*“What are the predominant cloud security risks in higher education institutions?”\* will be informed through secondary analysis of breach reports, while \*“How do governance frameworks influence risk management?”\* will rely on qualitative interviews with IT administrators.  



This activity underscored the importance of methodological transparency, logical progression, and ethical accountability in research design.

\## 5. Seminar Reflection: Peer Review of Methodologies

During the Unit 3 seminar, I conducted a \*\*peer comparison of two cybersecurity studies\*\* employing contrasting methodologies:



1\. \*\*Qualitative study\*\* – explored insider-threat behaviour through semi-structured interviews.  

&nbsp;  - \*Strengths:\* offered deep contextual understanding of user motivation and policy gaps.  

&nbsp;  - \*Limitations:\* lacked statistical representativeness.  



2\. \*\*Quantitative study\*\* – applied network telemetry analysis to identify attack trends.  

&nbsp;  - \*Strengths:\* produced replicable, data-driven insights.  

&nbsp;  - \*Limitations:\* overlooked socio-technical factors influencing security outcomes.  



Evaluating these papers reinforced the value of \*\*methodological complementarity\*\*—the idea that no single method fully captures the complexity of cybersecurity phenomena.  

This insight directly shaped my decision to integrate qualitative and quantitative elements in my own research to achieve both analytical precision and contextual depth.

\## 6. Reflection

Unit 3 marked a pivotal transition from defining research questions to designing a \*\*philosophically coherent and methodologically rigorous study\*\*.  

I now appreciate how methodological alignment enhances reliability, validity, and ethical integrity.  

By situating my work within a \*\*pragmatic paradigm\*\*, I can bridge interpretivist insights (how organisational culture affects security behaviour) with positivist data analysis (quantitative breach statistics).  



This integrative perspective not only strengthens the credibility of my research but also mirrors the complexity of cybersecurity governance in higher education.  

Overall, this unit solidified my methodological competence and prepared me to operationalise data-collection strategies in forthcoming units.
