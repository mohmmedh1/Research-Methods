# Unit 3 – Methodology and Research Methods

## 1. Overview
This unit advanced my understanding of **research methodology** and the philosophical assumptions underpinning scholarly investigation.  
As Saunders, Lewis and Thornhill (2023) emphasise, methodology extends beyond the mere selection of tools — it represents the theoretical lens through which research is conceived, justified, and interpreted.  
Researchers must therefore acknowledge the influence of their **ontological** (reality), **epistemological** (knowledge), and **axiological** (values) assumptions across all stages of inquiry.

In the context of my study on *cloud security risks within higher education*, this awareness proved transformative. It clarified that methodological decisions must align with the nature of the research problem, ensuring both theoretical rigour and contextual relevance. Methodology, therefore, becomes the bridge between abstract reasoning and practical evidence.

## 2. Research Design
A coherent **research design** serves as the blueprint for how data are collected, analysed, and interpreted.  
According to the British Research Methodology (n.d.), research design can be broadly categorised as:

- **Exploratory research** – applied when investigating emerging or underexplored issues to generate new insights.  
- **Conclusive (descriptive) research** – used to test hypotheses and quantify relationships between variables.

Given the dynamic and context-specific nature of cloud adoption in universities, my investigation follows an **exploratory–descriptive design**.  
This dual design facilitates discovery — by identifying new forms of cyber risk and governance gaps — while allowing for structured validation through the categorisation of vulnerabilities and compliance patterns. It thus balances open-ended exploration with analytical precision.

## 3. Research Methods and Data Sources
This unit introduced the three principal methodological paradigms (Sage, 2021):

- **Qualitative methods** – explore perceptions, experiences, and organisational processes, suitable for understanding *why* and *how* phenomena occur.  
- **Quantitative methods** – focus on measurement, correlation, and statistical inference to reveal *how much* or *to what extent*.  
- **Mixed-methods research** – combines both paradigms to achieve triangulation and holistic understanding.

For this project, a **mixed-methods approach** is most appropriate. It integrates:  
- *Qualitative evidence* drawn from expert interviews, institutional policy analysis, and sector case studies to interpret governance culture and decision-making;  
- *Quantitative evidence* from breach statistics, compliance-audit results, and secondary datasets to measure the scale and frequency of threats.

Adopting a **pragmatic stance** allows the synthesis of both perspectives, ensuring that outcomes remain empirically grounded while capturing the social and organisational dimensions of cybersecurity practice.

## 4. e-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Review
The **Research Proposal Review** activity provided an opportunity to test the internal coherence of my proposed study.  
I critically examined how the **research aim**, **questions**, and **methodological framework** align with the philosophical assumptions informing the work.  
Peer feedback helped refine the rationale for using a mixed-methods design and clarified which techniques best address each research question.  

For example:  
- *“What are the predominant cloud security risks in higher education institutions?”* will be answered through secondary analysis of breach reports.  
- *“How do governance frameworks influence risk management?”* will be explored via semi-structured interviews with IT and compliance professionals.  

This activity reinforced the importance of methodological transparency, logical progression, and ethical accountability in research design.

## 5. Seminar Reflection: Peer Review of Methodologies
During the Unit 3 seminar, I compared two cybersecurity studies employing distinct methodologies:

1. **Qualitative study** – investigated insider-threat behaviour through semi-structured interviews.  
   - *Strengths:* generated rich insights into user motivation and organisational culture.  
   - *Limitations:* limited statistical generalisability.  

2. **Quantitative study** – analysed network telemetry data to identify attack trends.  
   - *Strengths:* produced replicable, data-driven evidence.  
   - *Limitations:* overlooked socio-technical influences on system vulnerability.  

The comparative review demonstrated the value of **methodological complementarity** — recognising that no single approach captures the complexity of cybersecurity phenomena.  
Consequently, I confirmed the value of adopting a mixed-methods strategy to achieve both contextual depth and analytical breadth in my research.

## 6. Reflection
Unit 3 represented a critical transition from defining research questions to constructing a **philosophically coherent and methodologically robust study**.  
It strengthened my ability to justify methodological choices and enhanced my appreciation for reliability, validity, and ethical integrity.  

Positioning my research within a **pragmatic paradigm** enables me to integrate interpretivist insights (organisational behaviour, human factors) with positivist analysis (quantitative risk metrics).  
This integration mirrors the multi-layered reality of cybersecurity governance in higher education, where technical, organisational, and human variables intersect.  
Overall, this unit consolidated my methodological competence and prepared me to implement data-collection and analysis strategies in the following stages of the MSc programme.
