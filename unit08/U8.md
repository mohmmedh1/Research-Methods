\# Unit 8 ‚Äì Data Analysis and Visualisation



\## 1. Overview

This unit shifted focus from methods to \*\*data as the unit of analysis\*\*, developing techniques for analysing and presenting both quantitative and qualitative results.  

Quantitative analysis extended Unit 6 summaries and Unit 7 inference; qualitative analysis emphasised \*\*coding\*\*, \*\*theme development\*\*, and the need to manage researcher bias when interpreting open-ended responses.  

The unit also introduced \*\*visualisation and dashboards\*\* as vehicles for evidence-based communication in professional contexts.

\## 2. Learning Focus

\- Compare \*\*quantitative\*\* vs \*\*qualitative\*\* analysis workflows (preparation ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí interpretation).  

\- Apply \*\*coding\*\* for qualitative data and recognise threats to credibility (bias, confirmatory reading).  

\- Select appropriate \*\*charts\*\* (bar/column, line, scatter) for the data‚Äôs scale and question.  

\- Build BI-style visuals that foreground \*\*KPIs\*\* and avoid misleading design.

\## 3. Charts Worksheet ‚Äì Results \& Interpretation

I completed the Charts worksheet in Excel (Exercises \*\*8.1B, 8.2B, 8.3D, 8.4G, 8.6C\*\*) and documented outcomes. Key findings:



\- \*\*8.1B ‚Äì Diets (bar of means):\*\*  

&nbsp; Mean(A)= \*\*5.341\*\*, Mean(B)= \*\*3.710\*\* ‚Üí A > B on average loss.



\- \*\*8.2B ‚Äì Replication check:\*\*  

&nbsp; Means reproduced exactly (A=5.341; B=3.710), supporting reliability of 8.1B.



\- \*\*8.3D ‚Äì Brand √ó Area (column):\*\*  

&nbsp; Area 2 shows higher counts for brands A and B vs Area 1; ‚ÄúOther‚Äù similar ‚Üí evidence of area-based preference differences.



\- \*\*8.4G ‚Äì Agent scores by batch (line + scatter):\*\*  

&nbsp; Mean Agent1= \*\*8.25\*\* (SD 1.03), Mean Agent2= \*\*8.68\*\* (SD 1.04), \*\*r=0.901\*\* ‚Üí strong positive association; Agent2 slightly higher on average.



\- \*\*8.6C ‚Äì Mean income by sex (bar):\*\*  

&nbsp; Female= \*\*44.23\*\*, Male= \*\*52.91\*\* ‚Üí difference visible; requires inferential test (e.g., independent t-test) for significance.

\## 4. From Visuals to Insight

\- \*\*Bar/column charts\*\* clarified group differences first observed in Unit 7 hypothesis tests.  

\- \*\*Line/scatter charts\*\* revealed relationships and supported trend/consistency checks (e.g., high r between agents).  

\- \*\*Summary measures\*\* (mean, median, SD) contextualised effect size and variance, guiding which patterns merit inferential follow-up.



\*\*Cybersecurity translation:\*\* the same patterns/visuals generalise to incident frequencies, response-time trends, and \*\*control effectiveness\*\* dashboards (e.g., correlating MFA coverage with phishing-related account takeovers).

\## 5. Qualitative Data: Coding \& Presentation

For qualitative responses (e.g., unstructured interviews), I planned a \*\*codebook-first\*\* approach:

1\. \*\*Initial coding\*\* ‚Üí descriptive codes tied to the research questions.  

2\. \*\*Focused/thematic coding\*\* ‚Üí merge/refine categories; surface themes (e.g., \*shared-responsibility confusion\*, \*policy awareness gaps\*).  

3\. \*\*Trustworthiness\*\* ‚Üí memoing, peer debrief, and traceable audit trail; align excerpts to themes; avoid over-claiming.



Visual presentation may use \*\*theme maps\*\*, \*\*matrix tables\*\*, or \*\*quote-cards\*\* alongside quantitative charts to tell a coherent, mixed-methods story.

\## 7. Reflection

Unit 8 strengthened my ability to \*\*choose the right visual for the question\*\*, to separate signal from noise, and to avoid misleading designs. It also reinforced the value of \*\*triangulation\*\*: pairing quantitative trends (e.g., incident metrics) with qualitative explanations (e.g., user practice, governance culture) to produce credible, decision-ready insights for cloud-security risk management.
