Case Study on Privacy

Case Summary

Ricardo, a local government records clerk, has access to confidential property tax records. Researcher Beth has permission to view only numerical data (de-identified information) but wants names and addresses to contact individuals. She asks Ricardo to provide this additional data to support her study.

Question 1: If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?

Answer:

No — Ricardo must not release the names and addresses. Doing so would constitute a breach of data protection and confidentiality.

Ethical Issues

•	Confidentiality \& Duty of Care: Ricardo has a professional duty to protect personal data. Sharing identifiable data without authorisation breaches trust and professional codes (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics, Clause 1.6 – Respect privacy).

•	Legal Compliance: Under frameworks like the GDPR (Article 5 \& 6) or UAE Data Protection Law (2021), personal data can only be shared for a lawful, authorised purpose.

•	Accountability: Ricardo is not the data controller; releasing information would exceed his authority.

Justification:

From a deontological (duty-based) perspective, Ricardo must follow the rules governing access control regardless of the potential benefits of the research.

Question 2: Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?

Answer:

If Ricardo had decision-making authority, he would need to weigh public benefit vs. individual privacy rights.

Ethical Issues

•	Data Minimisation: Only the minimum amount of data necessary for the research should be shared.

•	Informed Consent: Individuals whose data is used should provide explicit consent before disclosure.

•	Research Ethics \& Oversight: Ricardo should verify whether the study is approved by an ethics review board and whether anonymisation methods are in place.

•	Public Interest Justification: If disclosure benefits society (e.g., urban planning or health research), it may be permissible — but only under strict safeguards.

Justification:

Using a utilitarian lens, disclosure might be justified if it leads to a greater public good — but only if privacy risks are mitigated and consent is obtained.

Question 3: Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?

Answer:

Beth should not automatically be allowed to contact individuals unless explicit consent is obtained through proper channels.

Ethical Issues for the Records Department

•	Privacy and Data Protection: Personal identifiers should not be shared without a lawful basis.

•	Purpose Limitation: The data were originally collected for taxation, not research — repurposing without consent violates data protection principles.

•	Trust \& Reputation: Unauthorised disclosure could damage public trust in government data management.

•	Security \& Control: The department must ensure data sharing agreements and anonymisation techniques are enforced.

Best Practice:

If the research is approved, the Records Department could act as an intermediary — sending participant information requests on Beth’s behalf rather than giving her direct access.

Question 4: Suppose Beth contacts the individuals and receives 1/3 permissions, 1/3 denials, and 1/3 no responses. She claims at least 50% participation is required for validity. What are Beth’s options?

Answer:

Beth must respect consent boundaries and cannot assume non-responses as implied consent.

Ethical Options

1\.	Proceed with Consenting Participants Only:

Use the data from the 1/3 who gave explicit permission. The study’s validity may be affected, but ethics take priority over sample size.

2\.	Request Ethical Review Adjustment:

Beth may submit a modification request to the ethics committee to explore alternative methods (e.g., anonymised aggregate data).

3\.	Enhance Recruitment Efforts:

She could send follow-up invitations, improve study transparency, or use randomised anonymised data instead of personal contact.

Ethical Justification

Under the principle of autonomy, every individual has the right to decide whether their personal data are used.

Assuming consent from silence violates respect for persons and data subject rights under ethical research guidelines (e.g., Belmont Report, GDPR).
