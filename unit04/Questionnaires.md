&nbsp;Theoretical / Methodological Considerations \& Best Practices

• Use cognitive interviewing / pretesting (cognitive pretesting) to test how respondents interpret questions before full deployment. Wikipedia

• Use expert review / questionnaire appraisal to identify measurement errors, ambiguous items, or response difficulty. Wikipedia

• Avoid response bias (social desirability, acquiescence, order effects) by balancing positive/negative wording, randomizing question order, including reverse-worded items, and neutral options. Wikipedia

• Ensure completeness of options (use “Other” or “Not applicable”) and non-overlapping response categories.

• Keep the questionnaire as short as possible and focused on your research objectives to reduce respondent fatigue. Formplus+1
