\# Unit 4 – Case Studies, Focus Groups, and Observations



\## 1. Overview

This unit explored qualitative data collection methods—\*\*case studies\*\*, \*\*focus groups\*\*, and \*\*observations\*\*—which are fundamental to contextual and interpretive research.  

As Saunders, Lewis, and Thornhill (2023) suggest, these approaches help researchers understand complex human and organisational behaviours that cannot be fully captured through quantitative measures.  



The unit emphasised how each method contributes to data richness and validity when used appropriately:

\- \*\*Case studies\*\* provide in-depth insights into individual or organisational behaviour.

\- \*\*Focus groups\*\* enable collective interpretation of shared experiences.

\- \*\*Observations\*\* reveal naturally occurring behaviours in context.



For my MSc project on \*cloud security risks within higher education\*, these qualitative tools helped refine my strategy for examining governance and privacy issues that extend beyond technical vulnerabilities.

\## 2. Literature Review Outline Submission

In this unit, I formally \*\*submitted the Literature Review Outline\*\* for formative review.  

This submission marked a critical milestone in translating my research topic—\*cloud security risks in higher education institutions\*—into a structured analytical framework.  



The outline synthesised key sources, including NIST (2018), ENISA (2023), and EDUCAUSE (2024), and identified four primary thematic areas:

1\. Misconfiguration and data exposure risks.  

2\. Insider threats and shared-responsibility challenges.  

3\. Cloud governance and compliance frameworks (GDPR, NESA).  

4\. Mitigation strategies and best practices for academic environments.



Feedback from the tutor highlighted the strength of the thematic structure and recommended further clarification of the \*\*data-analysis approach\*\* for integrating both qualitative and quantitative sources.  

This feedback will inform my Unit 7 final literature review submission.

\## 3. Data Collection Methods in Context

This unit’s focus on \*\*case studies and qualitative observation\*\* strengthened my understanding of exploratory research design.  

In cybersecurity, organisational culture and human factors significantly influence data-handling practices and incident response. Therefore, adopting \*\*case study analysis\*\* is particularly useful for exploring privacy governance across universities.



I considered the following qualitative tools for my methodology chapter:

\- \*\*Institutional case study\*\*: analysing privacy policy enforcement at MBZUH and comparable HEIs.  

\- \*\*Expert focus group\*\*: gathering insights from IT administrators on compliance challenges.  

\- \*\*Document observation\*\*: reviewing anonymised audit logs and governance reports to identify data-protection gaps.



These approaches collectively enhance the validity and interpretive depth of my future empirical study.

\## 4. Seminar Reflection – Case Study on Privacy

The \*\*Unit 4 seminar\*\* centred on a case study examining privacy and data governance within the digital ecosystem.  

The discussion focused on balancing institutional accountability with ethical responsibility under evolving data-protection regulations.  



I contributed insights from the UAE higher education sector, particularly how universities navigate \*\*GDPR-aligned compliance\*\* while adhering to \*\*local data-sovereignty requirements\*\*.  

The session reinforced the ethical importance of consent, transparency, and anonymisation in both primary and secondary data collection.  

It also deepened my appreciation for the BCS and ACM codes of conduct, which emphasise that privacy protection is a professional obligation as well as a research requirement.

\## 5. Reflection

Unit 4 reinforced my ability to select and justify \*\*qualitative research tools\*\* appropriate to cybersecurity inquiry.  

Through the literature review outline and seminar discussions, I learned how privacy, ethics, and governance interact in real-world digital infrastructures.  

This understanding bridges my technical expertise with human-centred research practice, enhancing both the analytical and ethical dimensions of my study.



The formative submission and feedback process strengthened my reflective research cycle—moving from design to evaluation and continuous improvement.  

These insights will be crucial when refining my methodology and preparing for data-collection planning in Units 5 and 6.
