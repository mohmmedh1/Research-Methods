# Reflective Piece: My Personal Learning Journey – Research Methods and Professional Practice

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this reflection is to present my learning journey throughout the **Research Methods and Professional Practice (RMPP_PCOM7E)** module. It explores how I evolved academically and professionally — transitioning from a technically focused cybersecurity practitioner to a reflective researcher capable of ethical inquiry and analytical reasoning. This reflection draws on artefacts such as the Literature Review (Unit 3), Proposal Presentation (Unit 6), Statistical Worksheets (Units 7–9), and the final e-Portfolio. Each phase enhanced my methodological discipline, critical analysis, and ethical awareness, strengthening my ability to integrate research frameworks into cybersecurity governance.

## 2. Research Foundations and Methodological Growth
At the outset, I perceived research primarily as data collection and analysis. However, through studying **Anderson and Hepburn’s (2020)** discussion of the *scientific method*, I learned that research is a systematic process of observation, hypothesis, and validation. This understanding paralleled my experience in **SOC analysis**, where structured evidence and repeatable testing underpin reliable conclusions.

The **Malware Disruption Case** in Unit 1 introduced ethical reasoning through the **ACM (2018)** and **BCS (2024)** codes, shaping my understanding of professional accountability. I recognised that ethical judgement in cybersecurity mirrors research integrity — both demand proportionality, transparency, and respect for participants’ rights. Applying the **Menlo Report principles (Finn & Shilton, 2023)** reinforced the necessity of fairness and harm minimisation in every stage of inquiry.

My methodological understanding deepened during the Literature Review and Proposal stages. Evaluating *Cloud Security Risks in Higher Education Institutions* revealed a gap between theoretical risk governance and empirical validation in the UAE context. Feedback from my tutor prompted me to restructure the review into thematic clusters and clarify my sampling strategy, distinguishing between **systematic** and **narrative** literature approaches. This improved coherence and analytical rigour, leading to the proposal of a **CyBOK-based framework** for cloud-risk management in HEIs.

## 3. Analytical and Statistical Competence
Units 7–9 were pivotal for developing my quantitative analysis skills. Conducting **t-tests**, **chi-square**, and **correlation** analyses enhanced my statistical reasoning and ability to interpret results beyond numerical significance. I learned that statistical findings must always be evaluated in terms of *practical relevance* and *validity* — concepts that now guide my interpretation of cybersecurity metrics such as incident frequency, response latency, and SOC performance indicators.

These exercises mirrored professional practices at **MBZUH**, where I routinely analyse network and endpoint telemetry. The application of **validity and generalisability testing** taught me to question the reliability of data sources before making operational decisions. Visualisation techniques learned through Excel and Python have since informed the design of SOC dashboards that display trend analyses and risk heat maps with statistical confidence.

## 4. Teamwork, Collaboration, and Ethical Reflection
Engaging in collaborative discussions and peer reviews broadened my perspective on research ethics and professional communication. In **Collaborative Discussion 2**, we debated the limitations of the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**, which illustrated how empirical reasoning and collective critique lead to stronger analytical outcomes. By applying **Edmondson’s (2018)** principle of *psychological safety*, I encouraged balanced participation within our team, improving inclusivity and shared accountability.

Team-based peer review simulated a professional research environment, where constructive criticism fostered iterative improvement. I learned to interpret feedback as a growth mechanism rather than evaluation, developing resilience and emotional intelligence. These skills now extend to my leadership role, where I facilitate cross-departmental reviews of incident reports using a similar reflective process.

## 5. Personal and Professional Growth
This module has been transformative in shaping my research identity. My early focus on operational execution evolved into an evidence-based mindset grounded in ethical and analytical discipline. The integration of research methods into daily cybersecurity operations strengthened my capacity to communicate findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

I now employ reflective cycles, inspired by **Rolfe et al. (2001)**, after major incidents to evaluate lessons learned and improve SOC procedures. Moreover, I established a **Data Ethics Checklist** to ensure compliance with GDPR and UAE data-protection principles during risk assessments. These initiatives exemplify how academic insight directly improves governance and operational transparency.

Time management and critical thinking also improved markedly. Balancing full-time professional duties with MSc research required careful prioritisation, enhancing efficiency in both contexts. The discipline of maintaining my **GitHub e-Portfolio** has become a cornerstone of my reflective practice, providing an ongoing record of growth and accountability.

## 6. Conclusion (Rolfe’s Model)
**What?** – I learned to apply ethical reasoning, systematic research design, and statistical analysis to cybersecurity governance.  
**So What?** – These competencies transformed my approach from reactive problem-solving to strategic, evidence-based decision-making grounded in ethics and validity.  
**Now What?** – I intend to apply this reflective and analytical mindset to future initiatives, including publishing my cloud-security framework, pursuing **CISSP certification (2026)**, and mentoring colleagues in research-informed cybersecurity governance at MBZUH.

Through this module, I evolved from a practitioner to a researcher-leader — capable of merging academic precision with professional accountability. This transformation aligns with my goal of leading evidence-driven, ethical cybersecurity initiatives that strengthen institutional resilience.
