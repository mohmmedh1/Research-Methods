\# Unit 7 – Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing



\## 1. Overview

This unit deepened my understanding of \*\*inferential statistics\*\*, focusing on how researchers draw conclusions about populations based on sample data.  

As Purdue University (2023) explains, inferential statistics aims to uncover general patterns in a large group by analysing a smaller representative subset, accounting for uncertainty using probability theory.



The concept of \*\*hypothesis testing\*\* was introduced as a method to validate assumptions about population parameters. This analytical process supports evidence-based conclusions rather than estimations, enabling reliable data-driven decision-making.

\## 2. Learning Focus

The key learning objectives of Unit 7 were to:

\- Understand inferential statistics and probability principles.  

\- Introduce and apply hypothesis testing techniques.  

\- Identify correct probability distributions.  

\- Perform hypothesis tests and interpret results in real-world contexts.  



These skills directly support data analysis in cybersecurity research—particularly when validating trends such as incident frequency, control effectiveness, and user behaviour patterns.

\## 3. Worksheet Analysis and Findings

The \*\*Hypothesis Testing and Summary Measures Worksheets\*\* were completed using Excel datasets (Exercises 7.1B–7.6B). Below are the summarised results and interpretations.



\### 3.1 Summary Measures (from Unit 6)

| Diet | Count | Mean | Median | Std Dev |

|------|--------|-------|---------|---------|

| A | 50 | 5.341 | 5.642 | 2.536 |

| B | 50 | 3.710 | 3.745 | 2.769 |



\*Interpretation:\*  

Diet A achieved a higher mean outcome than Diet B, indicating a potentially significant difference in performance pending inferential testing.

\### 3.2 Hypothesis Tests



\#### Exercise 7.4F – Paired t-Test (Con1 vs Con2)

\- \*\*t-statistic:\*\* 2.875  

\- \*\*p(two-tailed):\*\* 0.01834  

\- \*\*Decision (α = 0.05):\*\* Reject H₀  

\- \*\*Conclusion:\*\* There is a significant difference between Con1 and Con2.



\#### Exercise 7.6B – Independent t-Test (Diet A vs Diet B)

\- \*\*Equal-variance t-test:\*\* t = 3.072 ; p(two-tailed) = 0.00275  

\- \*\*F-test:\*\* F = 1.193 ; p(two-tailed) = 0.5399 (equal variances assumed)  

\- \*\*Decision (α = 0.05):\*\* Reject H₀  

\- \*\*Conclusion:\*\* Diet A achieves significantly greater mean weight loss than Diet B.



\#### Exercise 7.3D – Chi-Square Test (Area × Brand)

\- \*\*χ² = 3.293 ; df = 2 ; p = 0.19276\*\*  

\- \*\*Decision (α = 0.05):\*\* Fail to reject H₀  

\- \*\*Conclusion:\*\* No significant association between Area and Brand in this sample.

\## 4. Interpretation

Following the standard four-step hypothesis testing framework:

1\. State H₀ and H₁  

2\. Set α = 0.05  

3\. Compute the test statistic  

4\. Compare the p-value and make a decision  



For Exercises 7.4F and 7.6B, \*p < 0.05\* led to rejecting H₀, confirming statistically significant differences.  

For Exercise 7.3D, \*p > 0.05\* indicated no significant relationship.  

These results reinforced the link between statistical inference and real-world analytical reliability.

\## 5. Reflection

This unit enhanced my ability to bridge \*\*descriptive\*\* and \*\*inferential\*\* statistics, applying analytical reasoning to interpret results with confidence.  

By performing t-tests and chi-square analyses, I learned how statistical methods underpin decision-making in cybersecurity—for example, comparing incident rates before and after policy enforcement or assessing training effectiveness.  



The exercises also improved my proficiency with Excel’s data-analysis tools, ensuring methodological rigour and replicability in future research.
